# Credit API Test
This project is part of the book [API Testing with Postman and RestAssured](https://leanpub.com/api-testing-postman-rest-assured-v1) **not lunched yet**.

The project is intentionally without code: it was created for you don't have to create an initial project structure
and add as needed libraries.

## txt files
There are `.txt` files in some directories. They were necessary for the project structure to be the same as required  in the steps contained in the book.
You can leave the files or remove them.
